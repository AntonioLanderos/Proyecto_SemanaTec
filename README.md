## Actividad Memory

🔢 Reduced the board size from an 8x8 grid (64 tiles) to a 4x4 grid (16 tiles), using only 8 pairs.

🎯 Updated the coordinate logic in the index() and xy() functions to work with the new 4-column layout.

🔄 Adjusted loops and lists to handle 16 tiles instead of 64 (tiles, hide, and drawing loop).

🖼️ Modified the screen size with setup() to better center the smaller board on the screen.

📊 The game still tracks pairs found and displays a win message when all pairs are matched.
